# Utrust typescript library

The official Typescript library for the [Utrust API](https://docs.api.utrust.com).

## Minimum Requirements

- nodejs (minimum: 12)
- npm

## Install

```
npm install @utrustdev/utrust-ts-library
```

or

```
yarn add @utrustdev/utrust-ts-library
```

## Usage

### API Client

#### Creating a new Order:

```
import {ApiClient} from '@utrustdev/utrust-ts-library';

const {createOrder} = ApiClient(<API_KEY>, <ENVIRONMENT>)
```

As environment you can either use `production` or `sandbox`. It defaults to `production` if nothing is passed.

Then you can just create a new order passing an `order` and `customer` object as specified in the docs, which will return you a promise with the following structure:

```
const {status, data, errors} = await createOrder(order, customer);
```

Where you can get:

- `status`: response status;
- `data`: which should contain `{redirectUrl, uuid}` in case of success;
- `errors`: in case something goes wrong

#### Getting Order's Data

```
import {ApiClient} from '@utrustdev/utrust-ts-library';

const {getOrder} = ApiClient(<API_KEY>, <ENVIRONMENT>)
```

Again, as environment you can either use `production` or `sandbox`. It defaults to `production` if nothing is passed.

```
const {status, data, errors} = await getOrder(uuid)
```

Using the order `uuid` that you could grab on order creation, you can later use it for fetching that specific order. This can be useful for checking order `status` if you don't build a webhook integration.
Other useful returned data includes:

- `created_at`
- `items`
- `pricing_details`
- `reference`
- `settlement_amount` - in merchant settlement currency
- `total_amount` - in original store currency
- `id` - order uuid
- `status`

A complete example of this payload can be found in the tests/API documentation

### Webhook Validator

The Webhook validator module can be used to verify an incoming event via Webhook.
For easy reausability you can just initiate your `WebhookValidator` with your `WEBHOOK_SECRET` (which you can retrieve on your Merchants Dashboard/Integrations), and then just call `validateSignature` with your webhook's `payload`
It simply returns:

- `true` - in case provided payload can be verified by provided `webhookSecret`;
- `false` - otherwise;

Example:

```
import {WebhookValidator} from '@utrustdev/utrust-ts-library';

const {validateSignature} = WebhookValidator(<WEBHOOK_SECRET>);


const isValid = await validateSignature(payload)
```
